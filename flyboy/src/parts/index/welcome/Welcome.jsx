              We are presenting you 10.000 unique NFTs. A one-of-a-kind digital
              collection of NFTs stored on the Ethereum Blockchain. Each Mouse
              is generated algorithmically by combining various traits, and each
              one is minutely picked and constructed to serve a certain role in
              The Mice House. Each mouseâ€™s appearance is generated at random,
              making each mouse special and awesome. Some, however, may be rarer
              than others, well, catch them if you can. Follow our storyline to
              become a part of this whimsical tale.
